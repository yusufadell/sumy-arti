Article Summarization &amp; Automated Image Generation

## Motivation

If you have been using Instagram for a while, you might have already seen a lot of media outlets uploading stories about their latest articles on the platform.

as a programmer, I feel like it is too much effort to create story images manually for the articles I
publish. My frustration led me to automate most of the process.

## Installation

Install the requirements with pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The easiest way to get started is to execute the `sumy-arti` file.

```shell
python sumy-arti.py
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

This will download the article and generate an image.
